## Why I Chose Cosmotology :
Cosmotology was always something I was interested in.  I was well educated, understood what brands were good and not, and most importantly why.  However, I really didn't understand why I wanted to write about.  I didn't know if I should talk what products are good and why other products were bad, I didn't know if I should talk about how to use certain products, and I didn't know if I should raise awareness with the bad side of cosmotology.  So, like everyone else, I did some research.  

The best article I used to help me with my project was [" How technology is seeping into the future of the beauty industry? " ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/how-technology-is-seeping-into-the-future-of-the-beauty-industry/)
