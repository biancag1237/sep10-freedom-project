## Why I Chose Cosmetology :
   I've always had an interest in cosmetology.  I knew why certain products were better than others and, most importantly, I was well educated in this topic.  I was genuinely unsure of my reason for writing this, though.  I was unsure about whether to discuss the benefits of certain goods and the reasons behind the drawbacks of others, about when to discuss product usage, and whether to bring attention to the negative aspects of cosmetology.  Like everyone else, IÂ did some research.  

   The best article I used to help me with my project was [" *How technology is seeping into the future of the beauty industry?* " ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/how-technology-is-seeping-into-the-future-of-the-beauty-industry/).  It was hugely beneficial to me in deciding what to write about and what I should write about.  I learned a few facts from it and how it can benefit the beauty industry. The lack of diversity and safety for everybody is the main issue facing the beauty business; the article really spoke to and helped me with that.  It gave me ideas for how we might all work together to make cosmetics more inclusive.

## Engineering Design Process :
   As of this state, I am currently in stages 2 and 3.  I have discovered the main problems of what I should right now, which is how technology can help the beauty industry to be more inclusive and safe for everyone.  However, I am leaning more towards stage 3, which is **brainstorming solutions for my problem**.  Some things that can help me with this problem is being more specific when it comes to research, such as searching up "*how can technology help the beauty industry?*" or "*how can technology help the beauty industry with being more inclusive?*"

## Some Skills I Developed :
Some of the best skills I developed while researching on my topic and working on this blog were...

### How to Google --
I learned how to research and how to find reliable resources for my topics.  I decided to go more specfic with what I wanted to find since there are so many other topics if I just search up something general.  Instead of just searching up " *technology and cosemetics* ", I searched up, " *how can technology improve the beauty industry?* ", and if I wanted to be more specific, I searched up, " *How can technology improve the beauty industry with inclusivity and diversity?* "

### Time Management --
When it comes to building projects, I know a lot of people say that time management was important to them, but I believe it was much more important to me.  We truly never stop learning, therefore in addition to setting aside time for my project and my blog, I also needed to continue learning.  I learnt how to be more relaxed about finishing assignments and stop worrying about it all the time by planning my schedule so that I completed my other tasks first and had enough time to focus on my project.
