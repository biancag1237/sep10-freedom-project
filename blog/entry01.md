## Why I Chose Cosmetology :
   Cosmetology was always something I was interested in.  I was well educated, understood what brands were good and not, and most importantly why.  However, I really didn't understand why I wanted to write about.  I didn't know if I should talk what products are good and why other products were bad, I didn't know if I should talk about how to use certain products, and I didn't know if I should raise awareness with the bad side of cosmetology.  So, like everyone else, I did some research.  

   The best article I used to help me with my project was [" *How technology is seeping into the future of the beauty industry?* " ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/how-technology-is-seeping-into-the-future-of-the-beauty-industry/).  It really helped me with what I wanted to write and what should I write about.  It taught me some facts and how it can help our beauty industry. The biggest problem with the beauty industry is not being diverse and safe for everyone, in this article it really helped me and spoke for me.  It showed me ways in how we can help with how to make cosmetics friendly for everyone.

## Engineering Design Process :
   As of this state, I am currently in stages 2 and 3.  I have discovered the main problems of what I should right now, which is how technology can help the beauty industry to be more inclusive and safe for everyone.  However, I am leaning more towards stage 3, which is **brainstorming solutions for my problem**.  Some things that can help me with this problem is being more specific when it comes to research, such as searching up "*how can technology help the beauty industry?*" or "*how can technology help the beauty industry with being more inclusive?*"

## Some Skills I Developed :
Some of the best skills I developed while researching on my topic and working on this blog were...

### How to Google --
I learned how to research and how to find reliable resources for my topics.  I decided to go more specfic with what I wanted to find since there are so many other topics if I just search up something general.  Instead of just searching up " *technology and cosemetics* ", I searched up, " *how can technology improve the beauty industry?* ", and if I wanted to be more specific, I searched up, " *How can technology improve the beauty industry with inclusivity and diversity?* "

### Time Management --
I know a lot of people say that time management was a big thing for them when it comes to creating projects but I feel like time management was an even bigger thing for me.  Not only did I need to create time doing my project and writing this blog, I also needed to learn more things, we really never stop learning.  By organizing my time with doing my other tasks first and find a good amount of time to work on my project, I learned how to be more calm with completeing tasks and not having to worry after.
