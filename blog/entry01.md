## Why I Chose Cosmotology :
   Cosmotology was always something I was interested in.  I was well educated, understood what brands were good and not, and most importantly why.  However, I really didn't understand why I wanted to write about.  I didn't know if I should talk what products are good and why other products were bad, I didn't know if I should talk about how to use certain products, and I didn't know if I should raise awareness with the bad side of cosmotology.  So, like everyone else, I did some research.  

   The best article I used to help me with my project was [" *How technology is seeping into the future of the beauty industry?* " ](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/voices/how-technology-is-seeping-into-the-future-of-the-beauty-industry/).  It really helped me with what I wanted to write and what should I write about.  It taught me some facts and how it can help our beauty industry. The biggest problem with the beauty industry is not being diverse and safe for everyone, in this article it really helped me and spoke for me.  It showed me ways in how we can help with how to make cosmetics friendly for everyone.

## Engineering Design Process :
   As of this state, I am currently in stages 2 and 3.  I have discovered the main problems of what I should right about, which is how technology can help the beauty industry to be more inclusive and safe for everyone.  However, I am leaning more towards stage 3, which is **brainstorming solutions for my problem**.  Some things that can help me with this problem is being more specific when it comes to research, such as searching up "*how can technology help the beauty industry?*" or "*how can technology help the beauty industry with being more inclusive?*"
